# Initial Thoughts and Comments
My name is Vince Moreno. I am currently entering my fourth year of studies in Computer Science and will be graduating with a Bachelors of Science in this field. Though I have not had any internships, I have a decent amount of hands-on experience in creating and testing safe/unsafe code, networks, algorithms, data structures, and software development. I could say I have the tools I need to hold my own in the early stages of my career as a software engineer. However, I want to go beyond that and enter the cybersecurity field. I have very minimal knowledge of how things work here. I have studied many videos and read useful info online, but I do not have any hands on experience. That is why I decided to start this home cyber security lab, in the hopes that I could gain understanding in how the cyber world works. The path is very clouded and I am not sure where to start, and I hope starting here will help me figure all of this out.
